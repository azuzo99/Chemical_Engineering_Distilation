# Chemical_Engineering_Distilation
Files from this repo were used in the process optimization during my chemical engineering internship
## #1 McCabe-Thiele.py
This project was used to estimate the number of plates in rectification column during process. It is needed to optimize the performance of the column and economic costs of process. I would try to not go into the theory of ChemE during this code
### #1 Plot Facet
At first step we define a layer of plot
### #2 Calculations
The second step is to calculate the data for lines given of the plot. Calculations are not really complex, but the formulas are :)
### #3 Stages 
According to formulas this part was given by numerical solution. When done the right number of theoretical and physical stages could be determined
### #4 Location of feed and residue
### #5 Plotting final data and print answers

## #2 TXY & PXY
Both are used by Chemical Engineers to check composition of mixture. This time we are using hexane and octane mixture in this esimation

These calculations contain the date based on chemical engineering formulas. They are based on calculations in numpy and visualization using matplotlib
